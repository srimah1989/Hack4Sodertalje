# Hack4Sodertalje

## Problem statement 
Adverse effects of heat waves on mortality among vulnerable group of population are well known. Heat waves in Sweden used to occur once in every 20 years in the past century. But this new millenium has given us a new climate challenge where it has occured 4 times since 2000. As suggested by the Swedish researchers from Umea extended hot days of 27 degree - 30 degrees for 3 consecutive days will increase the mortality and cardiovascular helth risk between 10 and 20 %[1]. Research suggests that effects of climate change will increase the occurance of heat waves and consecutive hot days during summer. This in turn will affect the elderly and people with cardiovascular diseases. 

PREPAREDNESS
Based on this we should have analyse the improvements necessary to existing infrastructures in Sodertalje municipality to provide "cool-down" spots to it's residents. Suggestions to increase resting spots under shades. Public air conditioned spaces. Indoor activies on hot days. Increasing public toilets and it's quality for people with difficutlies to feel welcomed on the city center (Instead of the current tin can in the middle of the city)
