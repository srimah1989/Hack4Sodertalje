## Problem statement 
Adverse effects of heat waves on mortality among vulnerable group of population are well known. Heat waves in Sweden used to occur once in every 20 years in the past century. But this new millenium has given us a new climate challenge where it has occured 4 times since 2000. As suggested by the Swedish researchers from Umea extended hot days of 27 degree - 30 degrees for 3 consecutive days will increase the mortality and cardiovascular helth risk between 10 and 20 %[1].
